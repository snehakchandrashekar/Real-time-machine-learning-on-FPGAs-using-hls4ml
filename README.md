# Real-time-machine-learning-on-FPGAs-using-hls4ml
Implement real-time machine learning for jet tagging on FPGAs to overcome latency issues and enhance data processing efficiency.

- Explored the different handles provided by the tool to optimize the inference - Latency, throughput, and resource usage.
- Made our inference more computationally efficient with compression and quantization.
- Translated models into synthesizable FPGA code for real-time jet tagging using hls4ml using Vivado HLS.

- Achieved a 48% reduction in resource utilization while maintaining high performance.
